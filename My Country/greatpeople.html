<h1 align=center><b><u><i>Great People & Martyrs</i></u></b></h1>
<h3><u>Mahata Gandhi</u></h3>
<p>
<img src="images/mahatmagandhi.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=left>
One of the most iconic men that ever took birth and still continues to survive in the lessons of passive-resistance and non-violence that he selflessly gave to the world, hence making it a much better place. He gave up everything, his law career; his house and wealthy family to fight for justice and for the betterment of his people who were being treated as third class citizens by the colonial British. Even in the harshest of conditions, he never gave up his morals and rules, no matter what the cost of it. Mahatma Gandhi has right fully been given the title of the father of the nation as India truly owes its independence as a republic and a democracy to this Short, thin brown man who needed a stick while walking to support him but who was strong enough to take the responsibility of an entire country and usher it to the world of sovereignty.

<h3><u>Bhagat Singh</u></h3>
<p>
<img src="images/bhagatsingh.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=right>
Bhagat Singh is rightly considered to be the most influential revolutionary during the Independence movement for India. When we think of all the martyrs who gave away their life for the pride and honor of their motherland, we often remember “Shaheed” Bhagat Singh. From seeking revenge on Lala Lajpat Rai’s death and 1929 assembly bomb throwing incident to the 116 days fast in jail, Singh was not a believer in Gandhian ideology of Satyagraha and non-violence. At the age of 23 Singh was sentenced to death along with Rajguru and Sukhdev while all three of them kissed the rope, put it around their neck themselves and died for the sake of Bharat Mata. Singh’s death proved to be an awakening for the youth of the nation which got committed to make India the Independent India

<h3><u>Subhash Chandra Bose</u></h3>
<P>
<img src="images/subhash.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=left>
Another great freedom fighter was Subhash Chandra Bose who was the founder of Indian National Army, more popularly known as “Azad Hind Fauj”. Subhash Chandra Bose was a believer in Swami Vivekananda’s teachings and had a patriotic zeal even as a student. During his days in Calcutta University, he had beat one of his British professors who made a racist remark over Indian students. Bose was a rebel and he joined the Indian National Congress and later became its president. “Tum mujhe khoon do, main tumhe azadi dunga” (You give me blood, and I promise you freedom). These are the ever famous words said by Netaji in his speech which motivated a large number of Indians to take up intense and serious actions towards freeing their motherland from colonial powers.

<h3><u>Chandra Shekhar Azad</u></h3>
<p>
<img src="images/chandra.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=right>
When it comes to remembering the powerful souls who gave away their life to see India getting independence Chandra Shekhar Azad is a sure name. One of the greatest freedom fighters and a revolutionary, Chandra Shekhar Azad was committed to free India by any means. First participating in Gandhi’s non cooperation movement, Azad later implemented the use of arms for the struggle of freedom. The unforgettable contributions by Azad include establishment of Hindustan Socialist Republic Association, mentoring and encouraging other young revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev and establishment of Jhansi camp. Chandra Shekhar Azad loathed the British rule to such extent that he ended his life by shooting himself because he preferred dying with pride rather than by the hands of British police.

<h3><u>Sardar Vallabhai Patel</u></h3>
<p>
<img src="images/sardar.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=left>
 A prominent leader of Indian National Congress, Sardar vallabhai Patel played a leading role in India’s struggle for independence. Vallabhai Patel took part in Satyagraha and while Mahatma Gandhi was in prison he led the Satyagraha in Nagpur. Sardar Vallabhai Patel also actively participated in Civil Disobedience Movement and Quit India Movement.

<h3><u>Jawahar Lal Nehru</u></h3>
<p>
<img src="images/nehru.jpg" height=200px hspace=20 vspace=20 align=right>
The first Prime Minister of independent India Jawahar Lal Nehru hasn’t gained much recognition as a freedom fighter which he deserves. Born into a political family Jawahar Lal Nehru spent most of his educational years in England but then returned to India as the struggle for freedom had been on his mind for a long time. Nehru was a staunch Gandhian. He believed in Satyagraha and was keen on adapting the non-violent methods for the freedom struggle. Jawahar Lal Nehru actively took part in the non-cooperation movement in 1920 and then the Civil Disobedience Movement. The last days of freedom struggle saw vigorous campaigns by Nehru and ultimately he took the responsibility as a Prime Minister of India to build a new nation with a successful economy.
